# Presidio-round-3
Hello Sir/Mam,
      Here is my round 3 assignment. I have used PHP as backend , HTML CSS as frontend and MySQL as database. I have primarily focused on getting the functionality done not on how it looks. I have 2 primary modules Admin and User and each one has functions related to it. I have attached the screenshot of the database output along with the screenshots of database in the folder named screenshots. Please check it out!
